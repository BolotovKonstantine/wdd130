            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Ice Rafting Company embarked on its pioneering journey in the early 2000s when founders Anja Eriksson and Lars Pettersson combined their love for the Scandinavian icy wilderness with the thrill of white-water rafting. From their modest inception, with initial excursions attracting local thrill-seekers, the company rapidly gained momentum, underscored by its successful night rafting tours beneath the aurora borealis and bespoke expeditions for scientific research. Their groundbreaking approach to adventure tourism propelled them to international recognition in the 2010s, alongside a commitment to environmental stewardship, earning them accolades and a reputation as industry trailblazers.</p>
            <p>The 2020s presented new challenges and opportunities, with the Ice Rafting Company navigating the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic by innovating with socially-distanced trips and virtual reality experiences, ensuring the safety and continuous engagement of their clients. With an eye on the future, the company announced its ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, while fostering a community of like-minded adventure providers through the 'Green Rafting Symposium.' As a vanguard of sustainable and exhilarating adventures, the Ice Rafting Company remains a symbol of resilience and innovation in the realm of extreme tourism.</p>
