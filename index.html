It boasts a diverse range of environments, from the frozen tundra of Siberia to the subtropical beaches of the Black Sea coast. Russia has a rich historical tapestry that includes the reign of the tsars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and its significant role on the global stage as a major political and economic power.
